## Network Analysis Project: Building a Recommendation System from a Bipartite Network

This repository is used to save the progress of the Fall 2021 Network Analysis Project. The goal of this project was to build a recommendation system for github repositories, based on the 2009 GitHub bipartite network, representing User-Repository-Watches (unweighted) relationships. A similar pipeline as used within this project can be applied generically to any bipartite graph, to build a recommendation for either of the two classes.

While the focus of this project was on understanding, applying and argue in favor or against theoretical concepts of network analysis using real-life data, the final product - a recommendation graph (that was statically saved for a max of 5 recommendations) - was  translated into a simple web-app, that can be visited via the following link:

# Get started

## Virtual Environment (Dependencies)

The project was (excluding the web-app) entirely written in `Python` and makes use of several external libraries. If you want to run the scripts and notebooks yourself, it is recommened to create a virtual environment (using the python environment manager) of you choice and then install all dependencies of it from the `requirements.txt`. Follow the following steps for create a stadard python `venv`:

1. Create a virtual environemnt: `python3 -m venv [name of venv]`

2. Activate the venv using: `source [name of env]/bin/activate`. You can decativate using the command `deactivate`

3. Update `pip`: `pip install --upgrade pip`

4. Install all dependencies: `pip install -r <path/to/requirement.txt>`

## Github API

We use the public GitHub API to dynamically query additional metadata to be displayed in our web-app and to gain additional metadata for our recommendation system. While the API has free access, using an API token increases the number of API requests to 5000/hour. If you want to run the scripts yourself, you must create your own free, GitHub API token. Follow the following steps:

1. Visit your personal [GitHub Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Create a new personal token and set the scope to `public_repo`.
3. Copy the token and save it into a python file in the following location `csripts/envvars.py`. Format your file as follows:

	```
	GITHUB=TOKEN=[your_token]
	```
4. The file is automatically ignored by `.gitignore`.
